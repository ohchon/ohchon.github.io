# ohchon.github.io

it may be possible for someone to remember everything they wrote or learned during development and to use it directly on the field, but I think it's very difficult.

Above all, the reason why I created this repository or blog is for me.

I made it to remind myself of what I have experienced and learned and to use it when needed.

Currently, it is not pretty, and there are not many posts. But I will update and develop it every day. 

Thank you.
